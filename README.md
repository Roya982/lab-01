A web page designed for training purposes 

here I tryed my best to creat a responsive web page for those sizes using CSS :

+ Mobile 480px-767px

+ Desktop : 768px-960px


### Common Breakpoints:
+ 320px — 480px: Mobile devices.
+ 481px — 768px: iPads, Tablets.
+ 769px — 1024px: Small screens, laptops.
+ 1025px — 1200px: Desktops, large screens.
+ 1201px and more — Extra large screens, TV.
